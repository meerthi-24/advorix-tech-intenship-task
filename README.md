❤️ Heart Disease Prediction – End-to-End Machine Learning Project

This project was completed as Task 1 during my internship at Advorix Technology Company.
The objective of this project is to build a Machine Learning model that predicts the presence of heart disease based on patient health parameters.

📌 Project Overview:

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early prediction can help in timely diagnosis and treatment.
This project uses supervised machine learning techniques to classify whether a patient has heart disease (1) or not (0).

🛠️ Tech Stack:

Python
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib

📂 Dataset

The dataset contains medical attributes such as:
age
Sex
Chest Pain Type
Blood Pressure
Cholesterol
Fasting Blood Sugar
ECG Results
Maximum Heart Rate
Exercise Induced Angina
ST Depression
Slope of ST
Number of Vessels
Thallium
Heart Disease (Target Variable)
Target Variable:
0 → No Heart Disease
1 → Heart Disease

⚙️ Project Workflow:

Data Loading
Data Cleaning
Feature Engineering
Feature Scaling using StandardScaler
Train-Test Split
Model Training using Logistic Regression
Model Evaluation

📊 Model Performance:

Accuracy: 90.74%
Precision: 90%
Recall: 85.7%
F1 Score: 87.8%
Confusion Matrix:
[[31  2]
 [ 3 18]]

The model performs well in identifying heart disease cases while maintaining low false negatives.

📈 Future Improvements:

Hyperparameter tuning
Try Random Forest / XGBoost
Add ROC-AUC analysis
Deploy using Streamlit
